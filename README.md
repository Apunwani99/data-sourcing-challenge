# data-sourcing-challenge

In this challenge we were given two dataframes to clean and merge, to congregate information about movie reviews.
This is done by making a dataframe from the NYT article search API of movie reviews of the past ten years, and then using The Movie Database API we are able to add the credits and other information from the movies to the review for a more robust dataframe.
